# Spatial UI Design System

## Overview

Spatial UI is a modern design system built for KTC Logistics 2025, inspired by glassmorphism and spatial computing concepts. It creates depth and dimension through layered interfaces with glass effects, subtle gradients, and thoughtful use of light and shadow.

This design system powers all KTC Logistics applications with a unified visual language and component library that ensures consistency, accessibility, and a premium user experience across all platforms.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Depth & Dimensionality** - Creating a sense of space through layering and visual hierarchy
2. **Clarity & Focus** - Ensuring important information stands out and is easily accessible
3. **Responsiveness & Fluidity** - Smooth transitions and responsive layouts that adapt to all devices
4. **Consistency & Familiarity** - Unified design patterns that create intuitive experiences
5. **Context Awareness** - Adapting to user scenarios, environmental conditions, and device capabilities
